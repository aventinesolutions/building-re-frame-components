# Building Re-Frame Components

This repository is meant to accompany the [Building Re-frame Components](https://purelyfunctional.tv/courses/building-re-frame-components/) course at [PurelyFunctional.tv](https://purelyfunctional.tv/)

The repo contains all of the code you need to live-edit the components in the course.

## Overview

Clone this repo

```bash
$CMD git clone git@github.com:lispcast/building-re-frame-components.git
```

Enter into the directory

```bash
$CMD cd building-re-frame-components
```

Now run Figwheel

```bash
$CMD lein figwheel
```

Open your browser to: http://127.0.0.1:3449

Start editing the code in `src/`.

I like to have my editor open alongside my browser so I can see changes as they are reloaded.
